# Research Journal: [Project Title]

## Overview
- **Research Focus**: Using deep learning to train an agent who can play the Agricola boardgame relative "well". Then investigate the difference in gameplay results between competitive and collaborative players.
- **Objective**: Achieve a foundation for using boardgame in business-related, system optimization course teaching.

  - Compared to other training model, model 7 shows the agent had fairly low points and was gradually outperformed by partners. The reason is the agent was set to explore new strategy (entropy = 5.467057108921686e-01) while the partners stayed strict to exploitation of learned ones (entropy = 5.467057108921686e-05). Even though the result seems disappointing, it might be a good way to improve the agent's ability once it learned to beat old tricks. Though this could take more time to train. 
- **Final Results** (if applicable):

### Tips for Maintaining Your Research Journal in README.md
1. **Use Markdown Features**:
   - Headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize content.
   - Bullet points (`-`, `*`) for tasks and lists.
   - Tables for structured data.
   - Hyperlinks for external references.

2. **Update Regularly**:
   - Commit updates to your README as often as necessary, ideally weekly or after completing major milestones.

3. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git's version history to track changes to your research log over time.

4. **Include Visuals**:
   - Add graphs, charts, or images to illustrate findings using Markdown syntax:
     ```markdown
     ![Description](path/to/image.png)
     ```

By keeping a well-structured README, you create a professional, transparent, and organized record of your research journey. It can also be easily shared with collaborators or used as part of your portfolio!
